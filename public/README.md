# How to Add Your Profile Photo

1. Save your profile photo (the one you showed me) as `profile.jpg`
2. Place it in the `public` folder: `r:\protfolio\public\profile.jpg`

The image will automatically display in the About page with the gradient border animation!

## Alternative: Use a placeholder until you add the image

If you want to show a placeholder icon instead, the code can be updated to show an emoji or icon when the image is not found.
